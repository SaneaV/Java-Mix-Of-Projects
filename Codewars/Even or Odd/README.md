<p>A simple task with CodeWars, which later turned into a more interesting test.</p>

<p>It became interesting how many times bitwise operations will be faster than an algebraic solution. Result for start value Integer.MIN_VALUE and end condition < Integer.MAX_VALUE:</p>

Algebraic: 5906ms <br>
Bitwise: 5ms
